Just a birb that's really into VR. I like to create content for VRChat and experiment with Unity shaders. However, my interest for computer programming was forged in the fires of assembly language, and so I still enjoy working with low-level languages and systems the most. Ask me about digital electronics or (old) embedded systems, and I'll keep talking for hours!
