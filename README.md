Just a birb that's really into VR. I like to create content for VRChat and experiment with Unity shaders. However, my interest for computer programming was forged in the fires of assembly language, and so I still enjoy working with low-level languages and systems the most (though C# is also pretty cool). I like building my own embedded systems or microcomputers and playing with them, on top of pushing the boundaries of what's possible with VRC's SDK and Unity graphics shaders.
